# React redux todo app bugfix exercise

Source code for a React redux todo app derived from a YouTube tutorial. Forked from the original author to use as an exercise in working with react and redux.  Includes

- The front-end, using react and redux (app)
- An API

There are some bugs however.  Some are show-stoppers, preventing us from running the app.  Others are a little more subtle, preventing some of the functionality.  Others are minor, just irritating console errors.  

Can you fix them all?

## Running the app

Clone the repo and run the following:

- cd app
- npm install
- npm start

**NOTE:** The API must be running in order for the finished code to work as intended. Seee "Running the API" below

## Running the API

The API is a dead basic node.js/express server, which stores the todos state in memory. Clone the repo and run the following:

- cd api
- npm install
- npm run server
- check its running by going to browser/postman

```
localhost:7000/todos

```
